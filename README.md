##What does it do?
ControlCast allows you to take control of your broadcast with the Launchpad Mini with hotkeys and also functions as a soundboard. 

Future plans for an internal CLR browser for displaying images on screen via an overlay.

##How does it work?
Most streaming softwares (OBS, XSplit) let you bind hotkeys to perform certain tasks when streaming to services like Twitch. Tasks like Start/Stop the stream, switching scenes, and muting your microphone. And 3rd party voice services often offer toggle to mute or hold to mute keybinds. (Discord, Skype, Teamspeak) 

Edit individual midi keys to:
* ``Send`` or ``Hold`` a configured hotkey combination.
* Play an audio file.

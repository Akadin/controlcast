##What does it do?
ControlCast allows you to take control of your broadcast with the Launchpad Mini with hotkeys.

##How does it work?
Most streaming software (OBS, XSplit) let you bind hotkeys to perform certain tasks when streaming to services like Twitch. Tasks like Start/Stop the stream, switching scenes, and muting your microphone. And 3rd party voice services often offer 'toggle to mute' or 'hold to mute' keybinds. (Discord, Skype, Teamspeak)

Edit individual midi keys to:
* ``Send`` or ``Hold`` a configured hotkey combination.
* Play a local or remote audio file.
* Show images or gifs in an overlay with animations.

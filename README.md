# ControlCast
A Launchpad Mini desktop application for streamers

##What does it do?
ControlCast allows you to take control of your broadcast with the Launchpad Mini with hotkeys and also functions as a soundboard. 

Future plans for an internal CLR browser for displaying images on screen via an overlay.

##How does it work?
Most streaming software (and other applications) let you bind hotkeys to perform certain tasks. Things like Start/Stop the stream, switching scenes, and muting your microphone in voice applications. 

With ControlCast you Edit the Midi Key to ``Send`` or ``Hold`` a configured hotkey. Or select an audio file to be played. Audio can be played in 4 different methods by selecting the desired functions. (``On Release`` & ``On Press While Still Playing``)

* Playthrough (``Keep Playing`` & ``Do Nothing``) Waits until the track is finished before starting again not matter how many times you press the midi key.
* Restart (``Keep Playing`` & ``Restart``) Restarts the track at the beginning everytime you press the midi key.
* Toggle (``Keep Playing`` & ``Stop Playing``) Toggles the track on and off.
* Hold to Play (``Stop Playing`` & ``*``) Pressing the midi key will start the track and releaseing the midi key will stop the track.
